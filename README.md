# Study_Penguins
---
Penguins are a fascinating and one-of-a-kind species. These waterfowl have a wide variety of interesting characteristics that make them stand out in the animal world. In this project three populations of penguins will be studied: Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap. These populations are found in different regions of the world, which allows them to develop different adaptations to survive in their environment.

In particular, this project focuses on analyzing aspects such as the sex of penguins, the length of their wings and the length of their beaks. These aspects are crucial to understand the dynamics of penguin populations and how they adapt to their environments. In addition, the analysis of these factors can provide valuable information on the health status of penguin populations and how they are being affected by climate change and other environmental factors.

In summary, this project seeks to deepen the knowledge about three penguin populations and how their biological characteristics can affect their survival and adaptation. Through detailed analysis of factors such as sex, wing length, and bill length, it is hoped to gain a better understanding of these waterbirds and their role in the marine ecosystem.
